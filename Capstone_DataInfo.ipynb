    "* Since it is not very intuitive to understand the location of postcodes, nobody can place them in their head, I will use street data.\n",
    "* But then the question comes, how to define coordinates of street? One possible way may be to use mid points of street start and street end.\n",
    "  * We make an assumption that for a small part of Earth such as a street, the region is flat.\n",
    "  * So we take the starting street address and ending street address and compute the mid point of those two geo-coordinates."
