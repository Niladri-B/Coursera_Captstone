## Project material for the final project- Clustering Analysis of Transport options in Oslo

This repo has all the code associated with the various stages of the Capstone project for the IBM Data Science professional certification.
For the final Capstone Project, we had to come up with our own ideas for using the Foursquare API which is a location data provider.

Since I recently moved to Oslo, I thought one fun way to explore the city, while combining the skills from the certification would be to embark on a hypothetical project for _transport options_ in Oslo - the idea being, if the transport dept. were to prioritise building more infrastructure, what areas of Oslo should be looked into.

I undertook a **street-level** analysis, full details of which can be found in this folder here: [Main Project](https://github.com/Niladri-B/Coursera_Captstone/tree/master/wk4)
